# MANUAL TECNICO

## 1. Introduction
### Purpose of the Document
This document serves as a comprehensive technical manual for the CourierBackend project, detailing all aspects of the system's architecture and implementation.

### Scope of the Project
This project aims to provide a robust backend system for managing courier services.

## 2. Functional Requirements
### User Stories
- As a user, I want to register for an account so that I can manage my orders.
- As an admin, I want to view all orders to monitor the system.

### Use Cases
- Registering a new user
- Placing an order

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
### Performance
The system should handle 1000 concurrent users with a response time of less than 200ms.

### Security
All user data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.

### Usability
The system should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate.

### Reliability
The system should have 99.9% uptime.

## 4. Database Design
### ER Diagrams

### Table Structures
- **Users**: Stores user information.
- **Orders**: Stores details of each order.

### Relationships
- Each user can have multiple orders.

## 5. API Endpoints

| POST   | /api/orders        | Create a new order        |

## 6. Deployment
### Deployment Process
The application can be deployed using Docker containers.

### Environment Configurations
- **Development**: Local environment settings.
- **Production**: Cloud environment settings.

## 7. Testing
### Testing Strategies
- Unit testing for individual components.
- Integration testing for the entire system.

### Types of Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Tests for individual functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests for the interaction between components.

### Testing Tools
- Jest for JavaScript testing.

## 8. CI/CD
### CI/CD Pipeline Overview
The CI/CD pipeline automates the deployment process.

### Tools Used
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### Steps in the Pipeline
1. Code Commit
2. Build
3. Test
4. Deploy

## 9. Monitoring
### Monitoring Tools
- Prometheus for metrics collection.

### Metrics to Monitor
